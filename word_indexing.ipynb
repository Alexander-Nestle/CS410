The representative  gave me spiels about different rates for different amounts, both of which were more than 30% below the market rate. On top of this there was a $12 charge. The representative then proceeded to tell me she had access to the rates at various Japanese airports and that hers were better. When I got to Japan the rates at the airport were far superior even if not at market rate. When I declined to change money with her she seemed annoyed, as if somehow I should just let myself be ripped off because it was in her interest. Do not use this branch of Travelex under any circumstances. They seem to rely almost totally on people not doing their research. Those days are long over now with everyone having access to mobile data. Unsurprisingly there was no one using the booth in the two hours I waited there. My advice is offer competitive rates that cover your costs and your business will flourish as currency exchange booths are doing all around the world. Appalling service and product.

So much to see, from the botanical gardens, to the museum, and the Japanese tea gardens. You cannot fit it all in one day. Definitely recommend you take a trip here. There is plenty of parking in the structure. Make sure you pack some water and have sufficient funds to purchase food, and passes to each area. A great place to go for a stroll! If you're willing to spend the extra $ there's plenty more to see! We didn't have enough time to stop in to either the botanical gardens or the Japanese garden but heard many good things. I love golden gate park. I've been exploring various areas over the past few months. If you're looking for somewhere to sit, the garden area between the museums is excellent. For a light walk I strongly recommend wandering through the memorial garden, or the ponds near the botanical gardens. For those more adventurous with a couple of hours,I would recommend boating or hiking the waterfall at Stow lake...there's plenty of parking and a little cafe. If you're very ambitious, enter at the museums, see the botanical gardens and lily pond, the gardens next to the conservatory, and walk through the grounds all the way to the Dutch windmills and then see the ocean. Absolutely beautiful place to go for a stroll at any time of the day. My friend and I walked 7 miles through it in one day, and it was beautifully secluded and serene while also being right next to civilization. I absolutely plan to go for a stroll through it again. \n",

I believe the young man's name was Hayden, he assisted me in my purchase of one of Ross' magnificent Spotted Gum beds. Thanks to the intoxicating Sandalwood and the new bed, I will certainly be sleeping well tonight! Well I must say, there is an absolute plethora of ceramics to peruse in here, each completely unique. Keen to come back and add more to my collection. Ross and his staff have exceptional attention to detail regarding costumer service and product knowledge. Our entire family have purchased furniture such as tables, beds and bedding. Our ceramic collection is remarkable thanks to the wonderful staff at Planet, and the vintage Japanese ceramics are covetable for sure! We are saving for our next piece of Planet. If you are in Surry Hills stop in for a friendly chat with Ross, Emily or anyone of the team. And if you are looking for travel tips to India, Ross has some cracker ideas for you.

      "review: Really nice center which is neat an almost theme park like. Lots of different shops and restaurants to choose from. It can get full but never cramped. It is a short distance from the waterfront and surrounded by hotels and condos. If you are in Waikiki you should go. This mall was really spacious with a ton of shops and dining. Beautiful to walk around during the day and night. We went several times during our trip to Oahu. Parking is $6/hr but can be validated with purchases in the shops/eating in the restaurants for cheaper pricing. A plus is its proximity to Waikiki beach, which made it so convenient to shop around and then sun bathe or vice versa. A beautiful mall with an exceptionally good variety of food and shops. Everything there is more on the high end featuring stores like Louis Vuitton and Hermes. The surrounding scenery is one to stop and look at as the Mall's design has so many unique features. This is another large multi story open mall, filled with pricey big-name stores, the kind that you can see in every major city. That being said there are little comfy chairs around with the odd tourist dozing in them. The food court is slanted towards Asian food, and the prices were reasonable. Prime central location in Waikiki. Big clean multi-level center with nice wide walkways that span blocks of shops and restaurants. Interior central walkway is comfortablely air conditioned. Adjacent to Beach Walk on the North end. A number of high-end stores for those who care. Bring your wallet (as in, expensive). Other side of the street has many more shops and restaurants including new high-end replacement of The International Marketplace. Most high-end shops require staff to speak both English and Japanese (some are more Japanese and English oriented). \n",

Clean, friendly and very enjoyable! The pool is spotless and so inviting. A very good and inexpensive place to stay. We found this hotel when looking for a low cost overnight option in LA and were very impressed by it. The room was very clean and well appointed, with little extras that we didn't expect for the price: eg coffee machine, fridge, microwave and bathroom amenities. Staff were friendly, helpful and the overall atmosphere welcoming and comfortable. Breakfast buffet was simple and delicious. Overall would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay near the main attractions of Hollywood, Griffith Park and Universal Studios. Decent hotel. Nice staff. Clean room. Great water pressure. Japanese restaurant next door is closed even though it looks open. Would definitely stay here again. My favorite LA hotel and I've stayed in dozens of hotels here.

An easy and seemingly safe 30 minute walk to Dodger Stadium. A $20 Uber to West Hollywood. Would stay again! I read a few reviews of this hotel, and they had made a comment that it was nice but seemed dated. I wasn't exactly sure what they meant until I stayed here. It is a nice big hotel in downtown LA, but when you are in the rooms it feels as if you've gone back in time 20 years. The rooms were clean, so there was no issue there, but this hotel could use a full renovation. I would likely not stay here again if I was in the area. I don't want that to deter you from staying at this hotel, just know that there are probably nicer new ones nearby. Hospitality was most definitely 5 star! Everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating! Last year my family and I stayed at the Sheraton hotel and it was the worst experience. This Hotel was such a refreshing experience with clean spacious rooms! The Japanese garden was so peaceful and zen like! Our kids went up by the waterfall to read. They enjoyed it very much! Nice, comfortable, clean hotel with excellent staff. I don't love where it is located in relation to proximity to touristy places. (It's not near much stuff, except the awesome art museums and the Disney Theater.)

We were also lucky to meet and hear an ex-inmate tell his own story. The birds and their nests are also an interesting side trip beyond all the prison stuff. The whole place is beautiful and feels like it's frozen in time. Awesome historical spot that is a ton of fun to visit. The audio tour is something you don't want to skip, there's a lot you can learn from a visit here. Definitely will visit again next time I'm in the area. It's the nice touristy thing to do in SF. I greatly enjoyed my experience. Be aware that it gets chilly here. \n",
      "If you're on a short amount of time, recommend going to the cell block first on top of the hill for the audio tour. It's pretty easy to get around with the audio tour and they have audio tours in Spanish, Mandarin, and Japanese as well. Be sure to look for Al Capone's cell right as you enter the cell block on the second floor. Plan your trip ahead and make reservation online. It is highly possible that you can’t get ticket to Alcatraz if you don’t buy the boat ticket beforehand. It was a very famous and popular historical island. I will leave the detail to be discovered by yourself. Remember to checkout the lookout of San Francisco from the garden/light house. It is really beautiful in sunny days. This is an amazing place with amazing history it is definitely a key attraction if you're in the San Francisco area.  The boat ride is very nice and the overall ambience of the island is incredible.  The audio tour is an excellent addition to this experience.  Don't miss out this is definitely worth your while. \n",

      "review: Huge museum with lots of exhibition halls through several buildings. A state of the art \"4-D\" theatre showing an exclusive movie. You'll spend hours and hours watching the very well curated exhibits. Lots of memorable photo opportunities. A full service restaurant and a cafeteria inside. Easily accessible by public transportation. A 12 minute walk from Canal St. More museums in the area. Awesome experience! One that everyone should experience. It's not just an American history (although much of it is), but everyone needs to remember the past and the \"superiority complexes\" that led to global warfare. Thought it did an excellent job portraying both history & personal stories. You could EASILY spend 2 days here. Don't miss the \"Beyond All Boundaries\" movie experience! This is a fantastic museum of history that should not be missed, esp. by youth. It tells the true story. We spent one full day, came back on a second visit just to see this museum. We could have spent two full days. Beautifully set up and there is construction if a couple other buildings going on which will make it a very large complex. There are elevators. Volunteers are nice. We ate at the restaurant and it was impressive. Not just a fast food cafeteria, but delicious choices for a nice sit down break during the day. Easy access to the museum from bus line or walking, depends on your hotel location. A very satisfying lagniappe to my New Orleans visit earlier this year was the time I spent at the National WWII Museum. My traveling companion really wanted to visit; my parents had highly recommended it from their visit two Thanksgivings earlier. The National World War II Museum is not what most people think of when they plan a trip to NOLA; add it to your list!\n",

      "WWII planes “fly” over the ticketing area. After acquiring your lapel tag at ticketing, start your visit sitting on a train seat imagining you are a soldier heading to parts unknown in an era where digital research simply doesn’t exist. See the phases of battle campaigns told through the experiences of the soldiers and support personnel involved. Switch it around and see the campaign from the perspective of a Japanese or German soldier. Stop for a minute and realize that every soldier in WWII came from a family, a village, and a country. Recognize the patriotism. Appreciate the passion for values. Grieve at the widespread loss. \n",
      "\n",
      "And when you walk out the door at the end of your visit to the National WWII Museum, carry your newly deepened appreciation for freedom with you. I know I did. What an amazing museum. So much information, and the interactive cards of following a person through that time was very interesting. There is a lot to see and a lot to do. The displays are very easy to see and the staff at the museum were very helpful. The restaurant in the museum had very good food and was a nice break between seeing displays. Plan on spending 5 or more hours here. \n",
