When u go in a store & see a sandwich named big boy & the price....1 will assume this will be a nice size sandwich. NOT!!!! It's a small little cheeseburger suitable for a child! A box full of curly fries & 2 onion rings. .... FYI..I KNOW UR A TOP RATED RESTAURANT but this is my opinion. This place is AMAZING! Everyone who works there is so accommodating and friendly. The food is absolutely DELICIOUS! There's so much on this menu and I can't wait to go back to try something else. They also deliver across the entire island which isn't common got most restaurants. If you're thinking about trying it, just go! You will not regret it! (Get the tater tot tower!) LOVE having an outdoor lunch during gorgeous weather days with My Husband and Lunchbox is a perfect spot!  Their Fish and Chips is excellent! Very, very clean. All very good comfort meals at a good price. Big boy burger look like a cheese burger deluxe from wendy 😤 and very pricey definitely thumbs down \n",

Loved eating at the Three Broomsticks restaurant, the atmosphere was all wizarding world and the food was good too. The light show was short but really good. The ride is great and worth the wait. Love how all the employees were good at staying in character. Definitely worth a visit if you're a potter fan. Awesome! Very fun experience the Christmas light show at Hogwarts was amazing. Don't be tricked by the line for the wand fitting though an hour and a half in line for a 5 minute recreation of the scene where they choose the childs wand. They randomly selected a kid from the crowd made them feel special gave them the chosen ones wand and then proceeded to usher us into the shop to purchase expensive wands and things. The kids parents still had to pay for the wand the kid received in the show but at a discounted price. Way to use a child to gain a sale. How do you tell your child I'm sorry I can't afford to pay 70 dollars for the wand that chose you I'm sorry baby The ride there stopped the first time so it kinda changed my experience by the end of it. Went again, though, and it was still as fun and terrifying as it can be to a person scared of heights. The look of the building is really cool and being there gives off such a good feeling. The shops are so cool and you really do feel like a little kid experiencing magic. They have a cool train and walking through and into stores made me really giddy. \n",

The ambiance draws you to a peaceful and amazing place. The staff's hospitality makes you feel welcomed and at home. Amazingly beautiful restaurants with great food. This place is a must visit. Love it! It was our first deluxe resort experience and we fell in love. We could only afford a standard view room but we added one night at the end of the week to experience a room upgrade to the Savannah view. We were so happy with our standard view that I just told Disney that they could keep the money for the upgrade and we would just stay in the standard view. Our standard view was considered a partial view and we saw all the animals. My daughter's ages 7 and 13 loved staying on the balcony to watch the animals. The decor of the resort is breath taking! Never seen anything like it. The Cast Members are all top notch. Room service was always spot on and quick to respond with any extras. The gift shop is probably one of my favorites. We will be back! We loved the decor and atmosphere of this hotel. It was the best themed hotel we have ever stayed at and cannot wait to stay here again. The staff was attentive and loved to teach our kids all about the animals. Whether you have kids or not, this needs to be towards the top of your Disney list! The best hotel I have ever been too. Staff are very friendly and the decor is unreal. We have the best views daily of the giraffes and other animals. The restaurants and snacks included in the Disney dining plan are unreal and this brownie was by far my favourite. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone. We loved it! It's kind of like a mini-safari without all the pesky travel. Great restaurants, amazing staff, and the public areas are wonderful. I really appreciate that they have staff at the animal viewing areas to answer questions. The rooms are less wow than you may expect for the price. As a mom I appreciate the baby changing stations and  child height sinks in restrooms. Great playground for smaller kids. \n",

      "review: This was such an amazing experience! My wife and I did the floor landing tour. The Helicopter ride was nice. There was a young child on the flight that talked on the headset alot while the guide was trying to talk. Luckily he went to sleep on the flight back. I would drive the next time to get a different experience and save on money. It was almost $1000 for the two of us, which is on the pricey side. I would have gave 5 Stars but the Transportation there was longer than I expected, about 30 minutes and the transport back was about an hour. We had to switch buses and the bus we got on the air wasn't blowing cold in 110 degree heat. One family got off and just got a taxi. Overall great experience. All I can say is WOW! What an experience we had! The tour company is amazing and their pilot was very friendly and knowledgeable! We flew over Vegas right as the sun went down and it was such a beautiful experience! Personally, I wouldn't use them again. They advertise that all seats have a great view when in fact they dont. They have 4 seats in the back and the middle 2 seats are blocked from view of almost everything. I was extremely disappointed to see that the 1 child that was on our flight was placed in the worst seat (middle back) where he was unable to see anything around the adults. Very disappointing.  They claimed the seating arrangements were based on weight and I'm sure they probably were to some extent however the one child could have been given a better opportunity for sure. I was warned not to book with them for these reasons and didnt listen but oh well, ya live and learn. we made the grand canyon helicpoter tour. It was really nice. The price is really fair. The tour is going over the hoverdamm, lake mead and then to the Grand Canyon. It was a pleasure to fly with you Fantastic experience and well worth the fee!\n",
      "Having had our original flight cancelled due to bad weather, we were promptly rebooked for the following day prior to our flight out of Vegas.\n",

The staff is nice and they provide refrigerators for people who need to keep that diabetic medication cold or for food. The room service is pricey. location is great. There is a parking lot you can park in or they have valet available. If you own a Tesla and want to do destination charging you have to do valet. Check in was a breeze but upon getting to our room the set of keys did not work. went downstairs and got a new set. new set did not work. went downstairs again and got a 3rd set and those did not work. they had to get engineering to fix our door. After that debacle everything else was great. View from hotel was great. Room was clean and everything worked as it should. There was a conference going on while we were there so elevators took forever. Might recommend asking if they have a conference before you book a room. The tower was a fun experience for the family, the computer screens that show all the points around the city. The outside view was fun with all the wind and watching everyone's hair blow was funny. The upper level restaurant was amazing, the whole room spins while you sit and eat. Recommend for anyone visiting the Dallas area. What a gorgeous hotel! Loved the view from my room & the sky tower. Was @ a convention & the service was great. Only thing that could be improved on is the waiters were a little 2 efficient @ clearing out dishes. 1 tried 2 take my food away when I wasn't finished - LOL! I have been coming to this Hyatt since the early 80s, as a small child, when we would visit family in town. 35 years later, it still stands for elegance and grace, staying updated and swanky. When I sit at the bar/lounge upstairs, I can simply enjoy the beautiful elevators delivering its single serving tenants to their respective wings with amazing views of the city and comfortable accommodating rooms. They have a few restaurants to haunt if you wish to dine in and take a ride up the Reunion Tower to take in the entire city views  at 360 degrees. If you can, I recommend the Dallas Skyline views if you can swing it, as that is such a highlight of this hotel. \n",

      "review: I have very little interest in American Girl items and no real reason to be purchasing any of them. That being said, visiting the store since we were already in the Rockefeller center was well worth it. It's a really large store for just one doll brand. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think it helped that my partner had much more personal interest in the items and knew at least a little history of the brand. It was kinda fun to see some of the history of the dolls and how they've developed over time into a really diverse and very high quality brand. \n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't go in as a consumer, and I didn't leave having bought anything, but I strongly recommend going and learning about why the brand is important and has so much history anyway. It is definitely pricey but if you are headed here, you probably already know it. With that said this place knows girls.  The store is beautiful, there is an adorable hair salon where both doll and child can get their hair done. There are so many options for accessories and everything is nicely displayed.  We also ate lunch at the cafe and my daughter loved that experience. They have special chairs for the doll to sit right at your table! Awesome! My 7 year old daughter and 8 year old friend loved it. We stayed until close, and they didn't rush us out (like they probably should have). Personally, I enjoyed the AG doll hair salon.\n",

      "This is a store to buy 18\" girl dolls and accessories. The dolls (girl and some boys) themselves can be personalized to look like a child. There are smaller size dolls as well (16\" and even some smaller), but those aren't customizable (~$120 each). An outfit costs around $30. They host tea parties occasionally and even have a doll salon to repair their hair (it looks like a real salon). It's fun for children to go in and look around, but the cheapest doll accessory is around $10 (sunglasses). They also sell American Girl books, which my 7 year old likes reading. They are historical fiction, and each \"girl\" has her own series about overcoming or accomplishing something (GIRL POWER). She and her friend had a great time browsing the store, even without taking something home this time (a lesson in the value of a dollar, her choice). She loves going and occasionally buying something. This store is the perfect combination of dolls and imagination for the children. My girls had a blast even window shopping. A word of advice would be to get on-line or phone and set up a Tea Time or Salon Visit for your child. Dolls can be provided there, no need to bring your own if you do not wish too. Phenomenal experience with my little girl!!! I surprised her with a trip to this location for her actual birthday. She had a memorable time. She was treated like a princess. I was able to reserve with complete ease three days prior. We arrived for brunch and to my delight the waiter served us birthday cupcakes along with a delicious chocolate mousse dessert. I can’t emphasize how grateful I am that this place catered to us all. We will be coming back soon!!! \n",

      "review: The quality of the food and drinks were good😋. Also the prices was reasonable. Our waitress was awesome!😁 Whitney was professional and informational👩🏾‍💼. My overall experience was four star worthy! However Whitney's service made it 5 stars. Thank you! I'll be back👍🏽. Greeter directed me to sit by the cashier in an almost empty restaurant. I sat where I liked. Waitress didn't bring my beer straight away. The salmon was drenched with sweet steak sauce. Just dumb. Tipped 10 anyway I was there and the following occurred:  A woman walked in with a toddler that wouldn't stop screaming.  After about 20 minutes, while I was waiting for my food, the toddler was still screaming and it was really bothering me, so I asked my waitress if something could be done to quieten him.  She shook her head \"no\" while mouthing the word, and that was that.  Since the child continued to cry and scream while I awaited my order, I walked over to the mother and very calmly asked her to please do something to soothe her child because he was being very loud and disruptive.  I was polite and reserved because I save my yelling for more important things than a hamburger joint that serves alcohol.  The mother explained that she was waiting for her takeout order, which was taking way too long (her words), and so I, satisfied and mollified, smiled and said \"no problem.\"  At that point, the waitress, who had stood on the side and did absolutely nothing while the toddler screamed his head off and bothered customers, finally decided to intervene, but on the wrong end of things:  She raised her voice to me and called me \"rude.\"  So over here, it's apparently not okay for a customer to ask another customer to tone it down (since the persons working there won't lift a finger to do anything about it), but it's apparently totally okay for a waitress to yell at a customer and call her \"rude.\"  The genius waitress should have kept out of it--I would then have gone back to my table, and the woman would have gotten her takeout order and left, and all would have been well.  But the behema waitress just had to stick her nose in--and not in a nice way at that--so I canceled my order and left.  From now on this joint will be known to me as Thank God I Fled I only gave this 1 star is because the app won't let me leave it blank. Unbelievable!  I was seated and gave me a menu by a sweet young lady who exhibited both professionalism and cheerfulness. That is where it ended. I sat for 25 minutes before a deshivled uninterested waitress approached the table. She introduced herself and took my order. I ordered the grilled sirloin med/rare with side of mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. She brought my iced tea and that was it......An hour later with no indication of getting any update on the delay let alone a steak i went to the bar and told the bartender...here a ten for the tea. I gave him ten dollars because i need to pay for the tea and tipping is how my mama raised me. BTW tip was for the bartender.  Never Ever Again. Great service and fast service on a Friday night. I got the bones bucket not sure if thats the actual name. Ribs, wings and fries. Portions are really generous. I will definitely recommend this location and go back again \n",
